//Sure, here's an example C program to print the contents of a file to the terminal:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   FILE *fp;
   char ch;

   // Open the file in read mode
   fp = fopen("test1.txt", "r");

   // If file is not found, display an error message
   if (fp == NULL) {
      printf("Error opening file.");
      return 1;
   }

   // Read character by character and print to terminal
   while ((ch = fgetc(fp)) != EOF) {
      putchar(ch);
   }

   // Close the file
   fclose(fp);
   return 0;
}
//Replace "filename.txt" with the name of the file you want to print to the terminal. This program first opens the file in read mode using the fopen function, and checks if the file exists. If the file is not found, it displays an error message and exits the program.

//The program then reads the contents of the file character by character using the fgetc function, and prints each character to the terminal using the putchar function. Once it has read the entire file, it closes the file using the fclose function.

//Compile and run the program in your terminal, and the contents of the file will be printed to the terminal.
